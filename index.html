        <p id="para">National Institute of Technology Meghalay(NIT Meghalaya or NITM) is one of the National Institutes
            of Technology. It is in Shillong, Meghalaya, India. Classes were started in 2010 at the Sardar Vallabhbhai
            National Institute of Technology, Surat.The institute is one among the 32 NITs in India established as
            Institutions of National Importance with funding support from the Ministry of Human Resource Development,
            government of India.The institute was set up by the Ministry of Human Resource Development by the NIT Act in
            2010. The foundation stone of NIT Meghalaya at Sohra (Cherrapunjee) was laid by then Union Minister for IT
            and Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal in October 2012.NIT Meghalaya was ranked 61 in the National
            Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) engineering ranking of 2020.The institute presently functions from a
            temporary campus at the Bijni Complex in Laitumkhrah, Shillong, of the North Eastern Hill University.The
            institute has been allotted a plot of land of about 300 acres (another 73 acres are to be added soon) at25°
            15' 22.00" N, 91° 44' 40.00" E in Sohra (Cherrapunjee) in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya for its
            permanent campus which is going to shift shorty (maybe in another 3-4 years). NIT Meghalaya proposes to
            construct a modern state-of-the-art campus to accommodate all its requirements so that logistics are
            minimized while the built structures are in harmony with the surroundings.[4][6] The Union Ministry of Human
            Resource Development (HRD) has awarded the contract for construction of the permanent campus to the Central
            Public Works Department (CPWD)</p>
